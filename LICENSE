    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive 
Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) 
(each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to contribute a Work to a Commons that the public can reliably 
and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in 
other works, reuse and redistribute, provided such use is for non-commercial purposes 
only. These owners contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and 
to encourage further production of creative, cultural, and scientific works for 
non-commercial use.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating this License 
with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that they are an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply this License to the
Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of their 
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of this License on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights.

A Work made available under this License may be protected by copyright and 
related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright 
and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, 
and translate a Work, but only for non-commercial purposes;

ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness 
depicted in a Work;

iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data in a Work;

vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, 
and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor 
version of such directive); and

vii. other similar, equivalent, or corresponding rights throughout the world 
based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Non-Commercial Use Only.

To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the Affirmer grants the 
public the following rights to use the Work, but only for non-commercial purposes:

i. Non-Commercial Use: The Work may be used only for personal, educational, 
or research purposes, or any other non-commercial purpose.

ii. Commercial Use Prohibited: Use of the Work for any commercial purpose is strictly 
prohibited without the express, written consent of the Affirmer.

iii. Attribution: Users of the Work must provide appropriate credit to the Affirmer,
include a link to this License, and indicate if any changes were made to the original Work.

3. Public License Fallback.

Should any part of this License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective
under applicable law, then to the greatest extent possible, the Affirmer hereby grants 
to each affected person a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, 
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise the Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights 
in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable 
law or treaty (including future time extensions), and (iii) in any current or future medium and for 
any number of copies, but only for non-commercial purposes.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by the Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, 
licensed, or otherwise affected by this document.

b. The Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any
kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including without 
limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, 
non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence 
or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible 
under applicable law.

c. The Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may 
apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work. Further, the Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining 
any necessary consents, permissions, or other rights required for any use of the Work.

d. The Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this License or use of the Work.
